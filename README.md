POKEDEX TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT 

HOW TO RUN APPLICATION:

-Run npm install to install the dependencies.

-Run npm start to start up our React app at http://localhost:3000.

Task:

Using the free https://pokeapi.co/ API create a site that lists the names of 25 Pokemon.
The list should include pagination buttons at the bottom, that click through to the next 25
pokemon and the previous 25 pokemon if they exist.

Clicking on a pokemon name should display more information about the pokemon (either inline
below the pokemon’s name, or on a new page - your choice). The additional information on the
pokemon should include the following:
- Image of the pokemon (called ‘sprites’ on this api)
- A list of the ‘stats’ for that pokemon (name and value)
- A list of the ‘types’ for that pokemon
- The weight of the pokemon (assume that the weight unit is lbs, and display that)
The emphasis of this task is on clean javascript writing, and data collection from an api.
The UI should be clear and usable - don’t worry too much about design and styling.
This task should take between 2 - 4 hours to complete.
Note: If you have a previous coding challenge that you have completed in the past, feel free to
submit that in the place of this one. If it touches on similar skill sets we’ll accept that in the place
of this one.

It’s highly recommended that you follow these instructions from scratch yourself to ensure that
they work.
